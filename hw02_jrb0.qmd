## Instructions

Complete the following exercises using the `lubridate` and `purrr` packages in R. Ensure that your solutions are optimized and use functional programming principles where applicable.

1.  Load the necessary libraries.
2.  Answer each question in separate R code chunks.
3.  Provide detailed explanations for your approach.
4.  Submit the rendered HTML file.

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(lubridate)
library(purrr)
```

## Exercise Functions:

### Question 1

Write a function (using r code and structure demonstrated in class) to calculate a z score for a given observed value, a mean, and a standard deviation value. And then use your function to find a z score for the following problem. (Research the internet to find the formula used to calculate a z score)\
Observed value = 25.77, mean = 23.54, standard deviation = 2.442

```{r}

z_score <- function(observed_value, mean, std_dev) {
  (observed_value - mean) / std_dev
}

z_score(observed_value = 25.77, mean = 23.54, std_dev = 2.442)
```

### Question 2

Write a function to calculate the natural log of a number multiplied by the common log of the same number divided by the cube root of a given prime number, $\dfrac{\ln x \times \log x }{\sqrt[3]{p}}$.\
Use your function to find the answer if the number to be used for both log expressions is 32 and the given prime number is 11, $x = 32, \;\;p=11$.\
Also use R code to round your answer to the nearest tenth

```{r}

log_calc <- function(x, p) {
  log(x) * log10(x) / (p ^ (1/3))
}

log_calc(32, 11)
```

### Question 3

Use and show R coding to calculate the standard deviation for each variable of the data table `mtcars` using the `Special For Loop Method`, which includes three components:

-   Output â€“ an object to store the results

-   Sequence â€“ the set of items to loop through

-   Body â€“ the operations performed in each iteration

```{r}

mtcars_st_devs <- vector(mode = "numeric", length = length(mtcars))

for (i in seq_along(mtcars_st_devs)) {
  mtcars_st_devs[[i]] <- sd(mtcars[[i]], na.rm = TRUE)
}

mtcars_st_devs
```

### Question 4:

Write only one line of the code to return only the leap years fo years 2024, 3021, 2000 or 1800, 800, 5050, 600 and 7156. using subsetting with `[]` and without using built-in functions.

```{r}

years <- c(2024, 3021, 2000, 1800, 800, 5050, 600, 7156)

[]

```

## Advanced Date Manipulation with lubridate

### Question 5:

Generate a sequence of dates from **January 1, 2015** to **December 31, 2025**, spaced by every **two months**. Extract the **year**, **quarter**, and **ISO week number** for each date.

```{r}

seq(from, to, by, length.out = NULL, along.with = NULL, ...)

```

### Question 6:

Given the following dates, compute the difference in **months** and **weeks** between each consecutive pair.

``` r
sample_dates <- c("2018-03-15", "2020-07-20", "2023-01-10", "2025-09-05")
```

```{r}

```

### Question 7: Higher-Order Functions with purrr

Using `map()` and `map_dbl()`, compute the **mean**, **median**, and **standard deviation** for each numeric vector in the following list:

``` r
num_lists <- list(c(4, 16, 25, 36, 49), c(2.3, 5.7, 8.1, 11.4), c(10, 20, 30, 40, 50))
```

```{r}

```

### Question 8: Combining lubridate and purrr

Given a list of mixed date formats, use `map()` and `possibly()` from `purrr` to safely convert them to **Date** format and extract the **month name**.

``` r
date_strings <- list("2023-06-10", "2022/12/25", "15-Aug-2021", "InvalidDate")
```
